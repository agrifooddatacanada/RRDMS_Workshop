Do you have reuse in mind when collecting your research data? Do you know how to tidy your data to make it reusable?

Join Michelle Edwards, director of agri-food data strategy and Lucas Alcantara, manager of research centre data from the University of Guelph to learn the best practices for data organization, documentation, and sharing. Participants will receive hands-on training and guidance, as well as the opportunity to network with other researchers and learn about the latest data management and sharing development.

## Workshop agenda

The workshop is available online or in-person but limited spaces are available for both options.

Dates: February 21 - 24, 2023

Time: 9 a.m. - 4 p.m.

### Day 1

### Data governance and metadata: what do I have to offer and who can use it?

-   Strategies for effective [metadata creation](Day_1/D1S2_Effective_Metadata_Creation/D1S2_Effective_Metadata_Creation.pdf), including available and tools in development

-   [Data governance](Day_1/D1S3_Data_Governance/D1S3_Data_Governance.pdf) -- who can access my data and data collected at the Research Centres? (Including Data governance [Exercise](Day_1/D1S3_Data_Governance/D1S4_Data_Governance_Exercise.pdf))

### Day 2

### Research data reusability mindset: from collection to storage

-   Review of the [FAIR data principles](Day_2/D2_All_Sessions.pdf).

-   The importance of [data reusability](Day_2/D2_All_Sessions.pdf) and how we can keep reusability in mind in every step of a research project -- developing a reusability mindset. Strategies to record data that meet domain-relevant community standards and are associated with detailed provenance.

-   A tour of the Ontario Dairy Research Centre will demonstrate the dos and don'ts of the various steps of research from data collection to storage with practical examples. \*

\*Tour will not be available synchronously for online participants. Online participants will have website tour links and the opportunity to ask questions at the end of the day.

### Day 3

### Basic R programming skills: tidying your data

-   [An introduction to the R programming language and the RStudio IDE](Day_3/D3S1_Posit_R_RStudio/D3S1_Posit_R_RStudio_Intro.pdf)

-   [Data manipulation](Day_3/D3S2_Tidyverse_1/D3S2_Tidyverse_1.pdf) in R with the aim of making a reusable "[tidy](Day_3/D3S3_Tidyverse_2/D3S3_Tidyverse_2.pdf)" format ready for visualization and modelling by other researchers.

### Day 4

### Advanced research computing skills: data explorer dashboard

-   [Shiny framework](Day_3/D3S4_Intro_to_Shiny/D3S4_Intro_to_Shiny.pdf) for creating web applications using R code.

-   How to build a Shiny Apps with a [dashboard layout](Day_4/D4S2_Shiny_Layouts/D4S2_Shiny_Layout.pdf) to [interactively explore your own research data](Day_4/D4S1_Shiny_Reactivity/D4S1_Shiny_Reactivity.pdf).

-   How to publish your Shiny Apps for free on the internet.

**For in-person participants**: Please bring your own laptop for the hands-on R programming training on days 3 and 4, as one will not be provided for you. Breakfast will be available daily at 8:30 a.m. and lunch will be provided.

This event is made possible by funding from [Compute Ontario](https://www.computeontario.ca/).
