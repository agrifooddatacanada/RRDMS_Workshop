Do you have reuse in mind when collecting your research data? Do you know how to tidy your data to make it reusable?

Join Michelle Edwards, director of agri-food data strategy and Lucas Alcantara, manager of research centre data from the University of Guelph to learn the best practices for data organization, documentation, and sharing. Participants will receive hands-on training and guidance, as well as the opportunity to network with other researchers and learn about the latest data management and sharing development.
